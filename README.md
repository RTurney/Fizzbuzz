 # Fizzbuzz challenge # 
 
 This is a repository for the fizzbuzz challenge from Makers academy. 
 
 This was the first example of using test-driven development as a means of producing procedural code. 
 Run any number in the fizzbuzz() menthod to see whether it returns fizz (divisible by 3), buzz(divisible by 5), fizzbuzz (divisible by 3 and 5) or the number. 
 
 ## How to run ##
 irb ./lib/fizzbuzz.rb
 fizzbuzz(number to run)
